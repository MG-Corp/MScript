# MScript
v1.0BETA 
## Documentation
MScript is extremely similiar to Python in syntax and features; however, there are some differences:
- `def` -> `func`
- `and` -> `&`
- `or` -> `|`
- `match` -> `switch`
<br />
There is two versions of print: `println` and `print`. <br />
`println` Automatically prints a value on a newline <br />
`print` Prints very value on the same line
